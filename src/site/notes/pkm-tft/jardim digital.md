# What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of notes and resources about a particular topic, organized into a network of interlinked ideas. It is a place for personal exploration and experimentation, allowing for a non-linear approach to knowledge building and sharing. Digital gardens can be used for a variety of purposes, from self-directed learning and research to creating a knowledge base for a project. The digital garden provides a space to explore and connect ideas, while maintaining a structure that allows for further exploration.
