Utilizo o Obsidian como intermediário entre as minhas anotações no [[pkm-tft/Roam Research\|Roam Research]] e o conteúdo aqui do meu [[pkm-tft/jardim digital\|jardim digital]]

Obsidian is a powerful note-taking tool that allows users to create, store, and organize knowledge in a graph-like structure. Using Markdown syntax, users can create notes, link them together, and easily access and share their information. The graph view helps users visualize their notes and make connections between them, while the powerful search and tagging functions help users quickly find what they need. With its intuitive user interface and powerful features, Obsidian is the perfect tool for knowledge management.
