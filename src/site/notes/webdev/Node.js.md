Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is used to create server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux. Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.
